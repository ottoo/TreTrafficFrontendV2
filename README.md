# TreTrafficFrontendV2

Tampere bus area traffic monitoring frontend version 2. I created an app about 2 years ago with
Angular 2 beta to try it out. I wanted to remake the frontend with React & Mobx-state-tree.

- React
- Mobx & Mobx-state-tree
- OpenStreetMap map tiles hosted with [TileServerGL](http://tileserver.org/) from my TreTrafficBackend repository
- [Mapbox GL JS](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) for showing the map with the tiles
